# SellFast – E-Commerce & Service Booking Platform

**SellFast** is a full-stack e-commerce platform that allows users to purchase products and book services in one place. Users can browse available items, add them to a shopping cart, and complete checkout, while admins manage products, services, and orders through protected routes.

This project was built to demonstrate a modern e-commerce workflow with authentication, role-based access, service booking with date and time selection, and order management using a scalable backend architecture.
